# CLAUDE.md - Coding Assistant Guidelines

## Build & Development Commands
- `yarn dev`: Run local development server
- `yarn build`: Build the production site
- `yarn start`: Start the production server

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Components**: Use functional React components with hooks
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **Imports**: React/Next.js first, third-party libs next, local imports last
- **CSS**: Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch for API calls with specific error responses
- **File Structure**:
  - `/components`: Reusable UI components
  - `/pages`: Next.js pages and API routes 
  - `/public`: Static assets
  - `/styles`: Global CSS

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with React (JavaScript, not TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Markdown files for content (in `/content` directory)
- Mailchimp for email subscriptions
- Fathom for analytics

## Next.js Important Lessons

### Static File Generation
For generating static files during build (like RSS feeds):
- Create a script in `/scripts` directory for file generation that uses Node.js modules
- Run this script during build using a package.json pre/post-build command
- Don't mix static file generation with Next.js data fetching methods
- Remember that files need to be written to `/public` to be accessible

### Data Fetching Methods
- Never mix data fetching methods (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps`) in the same file
- For pages that need to return XML/non-HTML content, use `getServerSideProps` with proper content-type headers
- Be cautious with Node.js only modules (fs, path) in browser context

## Browser Automation
Use your `web-browser` skill to preview the website

## Quartz Notes Build (Reference)
The notes section (`/public/notes`) is generated by Quartz locally. The Quartz source lives outside this repo, so agents typically:
- Copy notes from Obsidian into Quartz content (flattened): `scripts/copy-online-notes.js`
  - Source: `~/obsidian/v0221/`
  - Destination: `/Users/nnamdi/Programming/quartz/content`
  - The script ensures `index.md` exists for the notes homepage.
- Sync the theme overlay from this repo into a Quartz install: `scripts/sync-quartz-theme.js /path/to/quartz`
- Build Quartz in that repo: `npx quartz build`
- Sync output back into this repo: `rsync -a --delete /path/to/quartz/public/ public/notes/`

The theme overlay files live in `/quartz-theme` and are copied into a clean Quartz install by the sync script. Avoid editing `/public/notes` directly; regenerate via Quartz.
