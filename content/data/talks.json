Lightspeed partner Nnamdi Iregbulem spoke with Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey and Goodfire co-founder and Chief Scientist Tom McGrath, who previously co-founded Google DeepMind’s interpretability team. They discuss opening the black box of modern AI models in order to understand their reliability and spot real-world safety concerns, in order to build AI systems of the future that we can trust.",

He explains why seed valuations often reflect the opportunity cost of the founding team more than traditional factors like interest rates or public market comps, and highlights the rising costs of GPUs and AI talent as critical considerations.We also explored the traits that set exceptional founders apart — like strong domain expertise, adaptability, and demonstrated excellence — and why inference-based AI startups may have an edge over those focused on training new models.",
