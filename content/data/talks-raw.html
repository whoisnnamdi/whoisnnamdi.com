Lightspeed partner Nnamdi Iregbulem spoke with Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey and Goodfire co-founder and Chief Scientist Tom McGrath, who previously co-founded Google DeepMind’s interpretability team. They discuss opening the black box of modern AI models in order to understand their reliability and spot real-world safety concerns, in order to build AI systems of the future that we can trust.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azoBSxpkv7Y">Video</a></li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2025/10/gensf.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="336" height="188"></figure><h2 id="benedikt-stroebl-with-imperfect-verifiers-scale-fails">Benedikt Stroebl: With Imperfect Verifiers, Scale Fails</h2><blockquote>Verifiers are a hot topic in AI these days, where they play a role in both post-training and inference time scaling.

With the explosion of various developer tools and services in recent years, it's tempting to think that we've entered a golden age for software development productivity. However, contrary to popular belief, developer productivity is in fact declining, and this phenomenon risks bringing modern software development to a grinding halt in many organizations. In this talk, Nnamdi Iregbulem reveals a framework for thinking about developer productivity and charts a path toward reversing this dire trend.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://www.industryconference.com/virtual">Event page</a></li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2021/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h2 id="venture-games-podcast-by-chris-quaidoo">Venture Games Podcast by Chris Quaidoo</h2><blockquote>In Episode 4 of Venture Games, my guest Nnamdi Iregbulem, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, talks about being a lifelong gamer and self-proclaimed tech nerd, investing in Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite, his blog, whoisnnamdi.com, and being selected as one of Forbes 30 Under 30 in Venture.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2p9OMbLE4RRDvCFrq2wldm?si=UiFhbhiARjSeJE_FcHBnlw">Podcast</a></li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h2 id="views-by-pol-fa-an-s-gerard-garcia">Views by Pol Fañanás &amp; Gerard Garcia</h2><ul><li><a href="https://views.substack.com/p/nnamdiiregbulem">Interview</a></li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2020/12/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h2 id="igbopedia-podcast">Igbopedia Podcast</h2><blockquote>My guest is Nnamdi Iregbulem.

Further, blacks have historically been underrepresented in software development, accounting for approximately 2% of software  developers despite making up approximately 13% of the American  population. Many companies claim to be committed to diversifying their  software engineering workforce, and these promises have only accelerated  in recent months. However, aside from data revealing their prevalence  among software developers, little publicly available data or analysis  exists on the professional experience of black software developers. In  this presentation, I analyze pay gaps, paths to promotion, job and  career satisfaction, and other aspects of black software development to  better understand the career journeys of black software engineers.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://gitlabcommitvirtual2020.sched.com/event/dUYa">Event page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8juMZGuSvk">Video</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U3G5-nZZoySkIashsrQbd4BAEqJGwDq-cF_xnPRZiNQ/edit?usp=sharing">Slides</a></li><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/whoisnnamdi/black-dev-2020">GitLab</a>/ <a href="https://github.com/whoisnnamdi/black-dev-2020/">GitHub</a> Repo</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8juMZGuSvk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h2 id="what-i-learned-analyzing-the-earnings-of-11-037-software-developers">What I Learned Analyzing the Earnings of 11,037 Software Developers</h2><ul><li><a href="https://whoisnnamdi.com/highest-paid-software-developer/">Write-up</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14v-eLdpu2il8AMXU2a8rC4Nc4qaB2OyKTt6dALDhgJA/edit?usp=sharing">Slides</a></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14v-eLdpu2il8AMXU2a8rC4Nc4qaB2OyKTt6dALDhgJA/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="/content/images/2019/01/years_coding.png" alt="chart" loading="lazy"></a></p>
