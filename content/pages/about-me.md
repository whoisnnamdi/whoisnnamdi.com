### More about me:

I'm a geek at heart.

I've been fascinated by technology for as long as I can remember. I spent countless hours as a teenager building computers (currently rocking a 7700K 8700K / 7800 980 Ti 1080 Ti 3090 combo), coding up websites (R.I.P. PHP), and finding ways to game Google search (SEO is not what it used to be though). These days I spend just as many hours doing statistical analysis in Python, toying with neural networks (highly recommend Stanford's deep learning-based NLP class [CS 224N](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) and computer vision class [CS 231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)), experimenting with open source software, and advising startups on product and growth initiatives.

I love applying rigorous analytical frameworks and mental models to tough problems at the center of technology, business, and life. In the last few years I've been exploring [developer productivity tools](https://nnamdi.net/developer-productivity-trends/), application infrastructure, and machine learning in the enterprise.

I'm a [Partner](https://lsvp.com/team/nnamdi-iregbulem/) at [Lightspeed Venture Partners](https://lsvp.com), where I work with [companies](https://whoisnnamdi.com/portfolio/) like [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/), [Materialize](https://materialize.com/), and others. I spent four formative years investing in growth-stage technology businesses at [ICONIQ Capital](http://iconiqcapital.com/), where I sourced and co-led investments in leading B2B software and internet companies like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Epic Games (Fortnite)](https://www.epicgames.com), [ezCater](https://www.ezcater.com/), and [Brightwheel](https://mybrightwheel.com/) and and additionally invested in others like [Age of Learning](https://www.ageoflearning.com/), [Alteryx (AYX)](https://www.alteryx.com/), [Fastly (FSLY)](https://www.fastly.com/), [Relativity](https://www.relativity.com/), [SurveyMonkey (SVMK)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/), and [Uber (UBER)](https://www.uber.com/). My first gig out of school was Technology, Media, and Telecommunications investment banking at [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/).

I got my MBA from the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/). As a grad student, I worked at [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) as a product manager, took advanced computer science courses, and served as Co-President and Vice President of the Venture Capital and Tech Clubs, respectively.

I studied Economics at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/). While there, I worked at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) and on campus as a Student Tech, helping my fellow students solve their most dire computer problems.

I was selected for [Forbes 30 Under 30 Venture Capital](https://www.forbes.com/profile/nnamdi-iregbulem/?sh=2774f2426190) and [Venture Capital Journal 40 Under 40](https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/40-rising-stars-to-tap-into-in-2022/).
