## Inside the Black Box: The Urgency of AI Interpretability

> Recorded live at Lightspeed’s offices in San Francisco, this special episode of Generative Now dives into the urgency and promise of AI interpretability. Lightspeed partner Nnamdi Iregbulem spoke with Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey and Goodfire co-founder and Chief Scientist Tom McGrath, who previously co-founded Google DeepMind’s interpretability team. They discuss opening the black box of modern AI models in order to understand their reliability and spot real-world safety concerns, in order to build AI systems of the future that we can trust.

## Benedikt Stroebl: With Imperfect Verifiers, Scale Fails

> Verifiers are a hot topic in AI these days, where they play a role in both post-training and inference time scaling. But what if more compute at inference time doesn't always improve AI performance? I discuss with Benedikt Stroebl his research on the challenges presented by the inference time scaling paradigm, along with a particular application of agentic techniques to the world of cybersecurity.

## Seed-stage Valuation Insights - Fund/Build/Scale

> If a team hasn’t built a minimum viable product, secured paying customers, or demonstrated strong unit economics, what exactly are seed-stage investors betting on?  
>   
> To get some answers, I sat down with Nnamdi Iregbulem, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, to discuss what drives seed valuations, the traits of successful founders, and his perspective on AI startups.  
>   
> Nnamdi shared his journey from coding as a kid to investment banking at JP Morgan, growth-stage investing at Iconiq Capital, and now helping early-stage founders at Lightspeed. He explains why seed valuations often reflect the opportunity cost of the founding team more than traditional factors like interest rates or public market comps, and highlights the rising costs of GPUs and AI talent as critical considerations.  
>   
> We also explored the traits that set exceptional founders apart — like strong domain expertise, adaptability, and demonstrated excellence — and why inference-based AI startups may have an edge over those focused on training new models.

## The Next Trillion Dollar Market - 5 Lessons from Selling to Millions of Developers

> Think marketing to developers is all about hoodies and hackathons?  Think again. As the developer-led economy, now worth $50B USD is poised to grow to a trillion dollars, companies that offer products for developers must refocus to a business-to-developer (B2D) model as developers become not only users of products, but key purchasing influencers.

## Weighted ACV | MetricHQ

> Weighted Annual Contract Value (WACV) calculates the average contract dollar value with a weighted average proportional to the value of the contract. Essentially, higher value contracts are assigned more importance when calculating the total average contract value of a business. This approach is helpful to companies that have widely varying customer concentration by accurately calculating an ACV that is not skewed by contracts with low dollar value.

## The State of Black Software Development

> Recent events have raised awareness of pervasive issues facing blacks in America. Further, blacks have historically been underrepresented in software development, accounting for approximately 2% of software  developers despite making up approximately 13% of the American  population. Many companies claim to be committed to diversifying their  software engineering workforce, and these promises have only accelerated  in recent months. However, aside from data revealing their prevalence  among software developers, little publicly available data or analysis  exists on the professional experience of black software developers. In  this presentation, I analyze pay gaps, paths to promotion, job and  career satisfaction, and other aspects of black software development to  better understand the career journeys of black software engineers.
