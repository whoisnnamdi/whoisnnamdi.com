I’ve updated the Venture Activity Index for [Q4 2023](https://whoisnnamdi.com/vai/) data.

As a reminder, the VAI is an index measuring current venture investment across stages relative to the long-run trend. It’s a useful and simple barometer of activity and sentiment in the venture market. The methodology is [here](https://whoisnnamdi.com/venture-activity-index/).

Some small modifications since the last version of the index that I published in Q2 2023:

-   Updated data for Q4 2023
-   Removed seasonality from the data
-   Removed super later stage rounds post-Series D. This was causing excess volatility that wasn’t representative of the overall venture market

With that out of the way, here’s where we’re at:  
![vai_plot](https://nnamdi.net/content/images/2024/03/vai_plot.png)

-   Capital deployment remains depressed, sitting about 50% below trend
-   We’ve hit the trough but remained there rather than recovered to trend. It's a bit of a [dead cat bounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce)

Another interesting view of the data is to show the various components by stage:  
![vai_disagg](https://nnamdi.net/content/images/2024/03/vai_disagg.png)

-   The later stages spiked the most in 2021, the earliest stages the least. This then reversed, with late stage capital falling somewhat more than early stage capital
-   However, all stages are similarly depressed at this point relative to their respective trends

As I caveated in the first version of the index, if we continue to stay below trend I may need to update the definition of trend to recognize that we’re on a new trajectory. For now, I'll continue to use a long-term, constant growth rate to define the trend for each stage:  
![detrend](https://nnamdi.net/content/images/2024/03/detrend.png)

That's it! I think the data mostly speaks for itself here, so I'll keep my commentary light for this one. Will update this again next quarter.
